      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        Assignment #4 for FCC JS certificate.
        Design more elaborate than needed, as I wanted to use React and as a consequence, I also used 
        useReducer to manage state. Had a lot of fun with this project as I learned about 
        state, and the asynchonous nature of dealing wioth it because setState does not 
        make the new state immediately available for changes.
        Quite an eyeopen and glad I experienced the challenges and figuring this out.
