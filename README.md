## Description

The project is the 5th and final required project for the React certification through freeCodeCamp.

### See it LIVE right [here](https://nickp2791.github.io/pomodoro-react/)

#### Technologies

- React JS

## Lessons Learned

This project was not difficult to build at first, BUT a major huddle was passing the test script by FCC which passes or fails the project.
The test gives very little feedback as to what failed. As part of the learning process I had to learn to "snoop" inside the testing script to know exactly 
what and how things were being tested.

1. The test uses regex to validate to the output, which I included in the code afterwards.
2. By stepping through my code I found that my counter went in the negatives for a split second
3. Most important lesson, USESTATE IS AN ASYNCHRONOUS HOOK UNDER THE HOOD!!!
