# react-simple-calculator

Assignment #4 for FCC JS certificate.
        Design more elaborate than needed, as I wanted to use React and as a consequence, I also used 
        useReducer to manage state. Had a lot of fun with this project as I learned about 
        state, and the asynchonous nature of dealing wioth it because setState does not 
        make the new state immediately available for changes.
        Quite an eyeopen and glad I experienced the challenges and figuring this out.
